# Construction OS — Android App Screens

> Part of [`docs/screens/`](../README.md) · platform: **Android** (emulator). iOS and Web live in sibling folders.

Screenshots of the Construction OS mobile app (Expo / React Native, Android), captured against the
**local backend with seeded demo data** — real logins and live API calls, not mockups.

| Device  | `Medium_Phone` AVD — Android 37 (`google_apis_playstore`), x86_64, 1080×2400     |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App     | Debug build (`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) + Metro        |
| Backend | NestJS @ `localhost:3001` (`E2E_AUTH_BYPASS=true`) · Keycloak @ `localhost:8090` |
| Project | `DEMO-001` — _Bangkok Tower — Phase 1_                                           |

## Login flow — [`_public/`](_public/)

English UI (matching [`mockup/00_login_flow/mobile/`](../../../mockup/00_login_flow/mobile)); the
login header's language switcher is used to leave the th-TH default (QM-3).

| #   | Screen                                            | What it shows                                                                  |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00  | [Login](_public/00-login.png)                     | Landing — Path A phone form, Path B "Login with Email" as the secondary action |
| 01  | [OTP verify](_public/01-login-otp-verify.png)     | Passcode step for `+66 •••• 0010`, requested from the landing                  |
| 02  | [Email + password](_public/02-login-password.png) | Keycloak's hosted page in a Chrome Custom Tab, `cos` theme (§20.6.1 / QM-4)    |
| 03  | [Securing session](_public/03-login-loading.png)  | `VerifyingOverlay`, shown while the Path B code→token exchange runs            |

Captured by [`apps/mobile/scripts/capture-android-login.mjs`](../../../apps/mobile/scripts/capture-android-login.mjs)
(`cd apps/mobile && pnpm capture:android` — it installs standalone, see the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
— adb/uiautomator only, deliberately **not** Detox:
Path B hands off to Keycloak in a Chrome Custom Tab, and while Detox holds the UiAutomation
connection a `uiautomator dump` only ever returns the instrumented app's own window, leaving the
browser undrivable. The script asserts the screen it expects (e.g. `verifying-overlay`) before saving
each frame, so a mis-tap fails the run instead of writing a screenshot of the wrong thing.

## Site Engineer dashboard — [`21-site-engineer-home.png`](21-site-engineer-home.png)

The `SITE_ENGINEER` Home (`components/SiteEngineerHome.tsx`), captured against the `seed-realistic.ts`
dataset through a real Path A (SMS OTP) login as `+66811000009` — Waraporn Klinhom, a SITE_ENGINEER at
Ekachai. **English is the default UI language** (product-owner decision 2026-07-26 — overrides QM-3's
former th-TH default); data values (issue titles, the phase name) stay in their stored Thai.

Layout (product-owner decisions 2026-07-25/26): a **project picker scoped to the projects this engineer
is a member of** (`GET /projects/mine` → `project_members` — here `CWRD` + `R9CT`, auto-selecting the
first); one consolidated command card (a "PROJECT PROGRESS" title, the project name, progress %, the
schedule verdict as a pill, the current phase inline, and a **START / GOAL footer showing the project's
`start_date` and `end_date`** — the project timeline, not a work-hours window); the four quick-action
tiles (Daily report · Capture photo · Safety check → /inspections · Request materials); and a round mic
FAB. The background is a **solid tiered dark surface** — the ADR-071 blueprint grid was removed to match
the design tokens (which specify no grid; §32.7 prohibits blueprint imagery); the progress-bar **glow**
(the other half of ADR-071) is kept.

Everything is live, driven by real data rather than the mockup's placeholders (never fabricated): `76%`
is the BOQ-value-weighted earned percent from `GET /projects/{projectId}/progress` (§32.12); the phase
(`Phase 1: งานฐานราก` — the stored Thai name, its English gloss trimmed for display) is the derived
current phase from `project_phases` (ADR-070); `01 Jun 2026` / `31 Jan 2027` are the project's
`start_date` / `end_date` (formatted "DD Mon YYYY", PO 2026-07-26); and the issues are the project's
real `site_ops.issues` rows. The verdict
pill "Behind by 34 d" is **red** because the project is behind schedule (`spi` below 0.90, §32.12
Display) — the mockup's green "Ahead of Schedule" is a placeholder this data does not support. The
header badge "1 HIGH" (count first, then severity — mockup parity) is the worst severity present and
its count. The issue rows carry no "AI: 94% • BIM SYNC" chip because no such field exists on issues.
The header avatar shows the
signed-in user's profile photo (`platform.users.photo_url`) when one is set; with no photo it falls
back to their initials ("WK" here — Waraporn Klinhom has no photo), then to a neutral person glyph.

> **Why it reads "ช้ากว่าแผน" (behind) and not the mockup's "Ahead of Schedule":** `seed-realistic.ts`
> anchors its tasks to fixed calendar dates about a month wide, so every planned end date is now in
> the past and planned% pins at 100 while earned% sits at 76. That is the dataset ageing out, not a
> defect — the figure moves with `now()` by design.

Captured by [`apps/mobile/scripts/capture-android-home.mjs`](../../../apps/mobile/scripts/capture-android-home.mjs)
(`node scripts/capture-android-home.mjs`) — adb/uiautomator only, same reasoning as the login script
below. It asserts the `site-engineer-home` testID before saving, and fails outright if the progress
card is showing its "no BOQ-linked task" placeholder, so a screenshot of an empty card cannot be
committed by accident.

## Site Engineer dashboard — loading state — [`22-site-engineer-loading.png`](22-site-engineer-loading.png)

The same dashboard while its data is still loading: the reusable [`LoadingState`](../../../apps/mobile/src/components/LoadingState.tsx)
component (ADR-055 — the implementation of
[`mockup/mobile/imp_002_universal_loading_component_mobile_view`](../../../mockup/mobile/imp_002_universal_loading_component_mobile_view))
now stands in for the content instead of the "no data" empty states: a `micro` strip (spinner +
"Loading…" + %) where the picker goes — so the picker's "no projects cached" message never reads as a
failure during load — the `widget` variant (corner brackets + an analytics icon-plate + a "Loading…"
label + % + bar) for the command card, and the `list` variant (ragged skeleton rows + a sync-active
spinner and % on the first row) under both Active Issues and Upcoming Tasks. The percentage is honest,
not simulated (ADR-055 caller-owns-progress): the dashboard's caller derives it from how many of its
load steps — `GET /projects/mine` + the project's progress / issues / tasks — have settled (`0 → 25 →
50 → 75 → 100`); the copy is the project's own `common.loadingLabel`, not the mockup's machine strings.
Once every step settles the real content replaces the skeletons. (In this capture all four fetches
hang, so the honest value is `0%`.)

Captured by the same script with `CAPTURE_LOADING=1`
(`CAPTURE_LOADING=1 node scripts/capture-android-home.mjs`): it pauses Postgres so the dashboard's
fetches hang, relaunches so the screen re-mounts into its loading state, and screencaps the framebuffer
directly — uiautomator cannot dump the screen because the skeletons animate continuously ("could not
get idle state").

## App launch — loading state — [`23-app-launch-loading.png`](23-app-launch-loading.png)

Opening the app now shows the same [`LoadingState`](../../../apps/mobile/src/components/LoadingState.tsx)
`widget` ("loading A", ADR-055) on a dark ground while the persisted session hydrates and the brand
font resolves ([`src/app/_layout.tsx`](../../../apps/mobile/src/app/_layout.tsx)) — corner brackets, the
**app favicon** (the hexagon mark) in place of the icon-plate skeleton, the **brand tagline** ("AI-NATIVE
/ Construction Platform") in place of the top skeleton bar, then a two-step (hydration + font) percentage
and a matching bar (`50%` here: session hydrated, font still loading). This mirrors the login hero, and
continues the native splash's identity into the JS layer so `24-native-splash.png` → this state is one
continuous branded dark hold (same `#020617` ground, same mark + wordmark), not a colour or content jump.
The favicon + tagline are passed by the caller through the new opt-in `iconSource` / `heading` props
(ADR-055 — the component bakes no brand asset or copy; the dashboard's `widget` skeleton, which passes
neither, is unchanged). The tagline is the English brand default, not i18n: this renders before
`I18nProvider` mounts and before the persisted locale is known (QM-3's system default); the interactive
`label` is still omitted for the same reason. Captured by cold-launching (`pm clear` wipes the font
cache, widening the font-load window) and screencapping the framebuffer. (LogBox toast at the very bottom
is a dev-build artifact.)

## Native splash — [`24-native-splash.png`](24-native-splash.png)

The Android 12+ system splash (`android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`, `Theme.App.SplashScreen`)
shown for the ~1 s before the JS bundle mounts. Two changes from the original:

- **Background** darkened from `#0B1020` to **`#020617`** (`darkColors.bg`, the app-shell ground —
  `splashscreen_background` in `res/values/colors.xml`), so splash → launch-loading → app is one
  continuous dark surface with no navy flash.
- **Layout** reworked so the mark reads large and balanced. The old splash fed the whole wide
  `splash-logo.png` wordmark (878×154) into `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`, and Android 12 letterboxed
  it into the small square icon slot — tiny. Now the **icon is the square hexagon mark** (from
  `assets/favicon.png`, replacing the `drawable-*/splashscreen_logo.png` set), so it fills that slot at
  ~192 dp, and the **"CONSTRUCTION OS" wordmark** (cropped out of `splash-logo.png` and scaled per
  density into `drawable-*/splashscreen_branding.png`) moves to `android:windowSplashScreenBrandingImage`,
  centred at the bottom.

This is **native config** (drawables + theme in `android/`), hand-maintained beyond what the
`expo-splash-screen` plugin generates (the plugin has no branding-image option), so it changes only on a
fresh native build, not via Metro. Rebuilt with `gradlew assembleDebug` under **JDK 21** (Android Studio
JBR) — the shell's default `JAVA_HOME` (JDK 25) is not yet supported by the RN 0.85 / Gradle 8.13
toolchain and fails plugin resolution. Captured by cold-launching (`am start`) and screencapping the
framebuffer inside the splash window. The launcher app icon is untouched: it reads a separate
`iconBackground` colour (`res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml`), not these splash drawables.

## App screens — `00-login.png` … `20-profile.png`

The 21 flat files are the same route set as [iOS](../ios/README.md), captured by
[`apps/mobile/e2e/capture.spec.ts`](../../../apps/mobile/e2e/capture.spec.ts) from **one
`PROJECT_MANAGER` session** (`+66800000002` — the role with the widest data access), deep-linking
each route via `cos:///<route>`. They are not per-role views: unlike [`../web/`](../web), which is
grouped into role folders, this set documents routes as one user sees them — matching the iOS layout.

`00-login.png` here predates the login redesign — `_public/00-login.png` is the current landing.

## Known gaps

- **Per-role capture is possible now — this gap is closed** (2026-07-16). Path A needs a Keycloak user
  whose _username_ is the phone number (`identity.service.ts` `issueTokensForPhone` →
  `keycloak-admin.service.ts` `exchangeOtpForTokens` does a Direct Grant with `username: <phone>`),
  and [`provision-keycloak-demo.ts`](../../../backend/prisma/provision-keycloak-demo.ts) used to
  provision every demo user with the email as username, so no seeded role could complete an OTP login.
  It now uses the phone number as the username whenever the account has one; Path B still works
  because the realm sets `loginWithEmailAllowed`. `21-site-engineer-home.png` is the first screen
  captured through a real per-role OTP login.
  - Accounts provisioned before this change cannot simply be renamed — the realm sets
    `editUsernameAllowed: false`, and Keycloak rejects a username change with
    `400 error-user-attribute-read-only` — so the script deletes and recreates them, then re-links
    `platform.users.keycloak_user_id`. Re-run it once against an existing realm to migrate.
- **The flat `00`–`20` set cannot be regenerated on Windows.**
  [`apps/mobile/e2e/capture.spec.ts`](../../../apps/mobile/e2e/capture.spec.ts) writes to
  `docs/screens/ios/` and shells out to `xcrun simctl`, so as committed it only drives an iOS
  simulator. The Android equivalents are the two adb scripts referenced above.
